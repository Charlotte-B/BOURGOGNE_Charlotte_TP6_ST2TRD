Exercise 2

1. In simple terms, and a few sentences at most, what’s a design pattern?
  a. When should you use one?
  b. When shouldn’t you?
2. Write a small program that build a pizza with various toppings using the builder pattern. 
   Why is this a good idea? Think about scalability for instance
3. Find an original idea to implement a decorator pattern (not the one from the website). 
   Can you think of any limitations? No need to code here.
